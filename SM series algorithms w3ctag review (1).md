Hello TAG!

I'm requesting a TAG review of adding support for SM series algorithms in WebCrypto.

Now the SM series algorithms have been accepted by ISO/IEC  and  widely used in many industries and fields. That's why we propose to  add support for SM series algorithms in WebCrypto, just like RSA, SHA , AES , etc.  The relevant information about  this feature is listed below : 

- Explainer (minimally containing user needs and example code): [explainer.md](https://github.com/smx-gotoweb/webcrypto-sm-series-algorithms/blob/master/explainer.md)
- Security and Privacy self-review:   [WebCrypto Self-Review Questionnaire.md](https://github.com/smx-gotoweb/webcrypto-sm-series-algorithms/blob/master/WebCrypto%20Self-Review%20Questionnaire.md)
- GitHub repo (if you prefer feedback filed there): [webcrypto-sm-series-algorithms](https://github.com/smx-gotoweb/webcrypto-sm-series-algorithms)
- Primary contacts :
  - [smx-gotoweb](https://github.com/search?q=smx-gotoweb&type=Users)
- External status/issue trackers for this feature (e.g.  new state):  Not yet available

Extended information:

- Refer to the TAG's [API Design Principles](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/)

We'd prefer the TAG provide feedback as open issues in our GitHub repo for each point of feedback.
